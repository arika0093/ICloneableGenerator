Automatic implementation of the `IDeepCloneable<T>` interface via source generators. For library authors.

## Overview
Provides automatic generation of the `DeepClone()` method for types implementing `IDeepCloneable<T>`.
This works not only for `IDeepCloneable<T>` itself, but also for interfaces and abstract classes that inherit from it.

## Why this library?
### Problem
There are many libraries that implement DeepCopy. Why is this library necessary?

Traditional libraries implement copy methods by adding some kind of attribute to specific types.

```csharp
[DeepCloneable]
public partial class Person { /* ... */ }

// or
[DeepCloneable<Person>]
public partial class PersonCloneHelper;
```

This approach is not bad, but the automatically generated code cannot be accessed from the **another library side**.  
In other words, if the library wants to call the `Clone` method, it has to choose one of the following approaches:

#### 1. Implement a generic `Clone` using reflection
For example:

```csharp
// 3rd-party library
public static T DeepClone<T>(T obj)
{
  // Copy using, for example, JsonSerialize/Deserialize
  var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj);
  return JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T>(json);
}

// Nothing is required on the user side
```

This approach uses reflection, which results in poor performance. Also, NativeAOT cannot be used.

#### 2. Have the user implement some `ICloneable` interface
For example:

```csharp
// 3rd-party library
public interface ICloneable<T>
{
  T Clone();
}

public void SomeMethod<T>(T obj) where T : ICloneable<T>
{
  var clone = obj.Clone();
  // ...
}

// user-side
public partial class Person : ICloneable<Person>
{
  public Person Clone()
  {
    // Must be implemented manually
  }
}
```

This method allows free implementation and use of any library, but it is obviously tedious.

#### 3. Have the user specify a method for cloning
For example:

```csharp
// 3rd-party library
public class MethodConfig
{
  private Func<T, T> _cloneFunc;

  public MethodConfig SetCloneFunc<T>(Func<T, T> cloneFunc)
  {
    _cloneFunc = cloneFunc;
    return this;
  }
}

// user-side
var config = new MethodConfig()
  .SetCloneFunc<Person>(person => 
  {
    // Must be implemented manually
  });
```

This method also allows free implementation, but again, manual implementation is required.

### Solution
Add "IDeepCloneable" as a dependency on the **library side**.

#### Library Authors
On the library side, define abstract classes or interfaces that implement `IDeepCloneable<T>`.
Then, check for `IDeepCloneable<T>` and call the `DeepClone()` method.

```csharp
using IDeepCloneable;

// Optionally: If you want to define your own interface or abstract class on the library side
public interface ILibraryModel<T> : IDeepCloneable<T>
{
  // Define properties and methods required by the library
}

public class LibraryConfiguration<T>
{
  private Func<T, T> _cloneFunc;

  public LibraryConfiguration()
  {
    // Check if T implements IDeepCloneable<T>
    // Or, you can add a type constraint: where T : IDeepCloneable<T>
    if(typeof(T) is IDeepCloneable<T>)
    {
      _cloneFunc = obj => obj.DeepClone();
    }
    else
    {
      // fallback implementation
    }
  }
}
```

#### Users of the Library
Library users simply inherit the abstract class or interface defined above and add the `partial` keyword.

```csharp
using YourLibrary;

public partial class MyModel : ILibraryModel<MyModel>
{
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public int Age { get; set; }
}
```
