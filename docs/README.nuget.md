# IDeepCloneable

Automatic implementation of the `IDeepCloneable<T>` interface via source generators. For library authors.

## Overview
Provides automatic generation of the `DeepClone()` method for types implementing `IDeepCloneable<T>`.
This works not only for `IDeepCloneable<T>` itself, but also for interfaces and abstract classes that inherit from it.
